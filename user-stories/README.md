# User Stories – Airbnb Clone

## Purpose

User stories describe the system’s behavior from an end-user’s perspective. They help bridge business requirements with technical implementation.

## Structure

Each user story follows this format:

> As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit].

## Related Files

- `user-stories.md` – Contains at least 5 detailed stories derived from the Use Case Diagram.
- These stories will inform API design and testing later in development.

## Example
